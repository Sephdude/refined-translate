# refined-translate
Translate English to Puerto Rican Spanish.

## Model
The model can be found at https://huggingface.co/Sephdude/en-esPR.

## How It Was Made
The translator is a fine-tuned version of the Helsinki-NLP OPUS-MT-EN-ES trained on formal Puerto Rican Spanish text, then seperately trained on colloquial Puerto Rican translations to make the generated translations more casual.

## Dataset
The dataset used can be found on Hugging Face. https://huggingface.co/datasets/Sephdude/esPR-en
The data used originates from the mOSCAR general Spanish dataset https://huggingface.co/datasets/oscar-corpus/mOSCAR which was filtered through for Puerto Rican stylized text examples using Puerto Rican slang keywords and by saving Spanish text from .pr domain websites.
The English translations were generated by the Helsinki-NLP OPUS-MT-ES-EN translation model.
